To address this issue, several large-scale internet archiving projects have emerged, each with their own unique approach to preserving digital content. In this article, we will explore the history, storage devices used, pricing, and challenges faced by some of the largest internet archiving projects in the world.</p>

<h2 id="the-internet-archive">The Internet Archive</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Brewster_Kahle_2009.jpg" alt="Brewster Kahle in 2009" class="img-right" itemprop="image" /> Founded in 1996 by <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Kahle">Brewster Kahle</a>, the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is perhaps the best-known internet archiving project. The organization’s mission is to provide “universal access to all knowledge.” To achieve this, they have created a massive digital library that contains over 70 petabytes of data, including websites, books, music, videos, and more.</p>

<p>To store this vast amount of data, the Internet Archive uses a combination of hard drives, solid-state drives, and magnetic tapes. Hard drives are used for more frequently accessed data, while magnetic tapes are used for long-term storage. The cost of this storage is not publicly disclosed, but the Internet Archive operates on a non-profit model and relies heavily on donations to continue its work.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the Internet Archive is the sheer size of the data they are trying to preserve. As the internet grows, so too does the amount of data that needs to be archived. Additionally, the Internet Archive has faced legal challenges over copyright infringement and the distribution of copyrighted materials.</p>

<h2 id="the-wayback-machine">The Wayback Machine</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most well-known feature of the Internet Archive is the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>. This tool allows users to browse archived versions of websites from as far back as 1996. As of 2023, the Wayback Machine contains over 450 billion web pages.</p>

<p>The Wayback Machine has faced criticism over the years for not being able to archive every website on the internet. Some websites use technology that makes it difficult or impossible for the Wayback Machine to capture their content accurately. Additionally, some website owners have requested that their sites be excluded from the Wayback Machine due to privacy concerns.</p>

<p>To handle the immense volume of archived web pages, the Wayback Machine employs a distributed storage system. It utilizes a combination of commodity servers, network-attached storage (NAS) devices, and content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure accessibility and reliability. Challenges faced by the Wayback Machine include the continuous crawling and indexing of web pages, dealing with the dynamic nature of websites, and addressing copyright and legal considerations.</p>

<h2 id="the-library-of-congress">The Library of Congress</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.loc.gov/">Library of Congress</a> is the largest library in the world, and it has been collecting and preserving books, manuscripts, and other physical media for over two centuries. In recent years, the Library of Congress has also turned its attention to digital archiving.</p>

<p>The Library of Congress’ digital preservation program focuses primarily on audiovisual content, including film, television, and sound recordings.</p>

<p>To store this data, this project a diverse range of storage devices, including enterprise-grade storage arrays and tape libraries, to preserve its vast collection of digital content. Challenges encountered by the Library of Congress include the selection and prioritization of websites for archiving, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of archived content, and navigating copyright complexities.</p>

<p>Unlike the Internet Archive, the Library of Congress is a government-funded institution. The exact cost of their digital preservation efforts is not publicly disclosed, but it is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars per year.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the Library of Congress is the obsolescence of digital formats. As technology advances, older file formats become increasingly difficult to access and read. To address this issue, the Library of Congress has developed a program called the National Digital Stewardship Alliance, which aims to establish best practices for digital preservation.</p>

<h2 id="the-british-library">The British Library</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bl.uk/">The British Library</a> is the national library of the United Kingdom, and it is responsible for preserving the country’s cultural heritage. In recent years, the British Library has turned its attention to digital archiving.</p>

<p>The British Library’s digital preservation program focuses on a wide range of content, including books, manuscripts, and sound recordings. To store this data, the British Library uses a combination of hard drives, magnetic tapes, and optical disks.</p>

<p>The cost of the British Library’s digital preservation efforts is not publicly disclosed. However, the library operates on a government-funded model.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges faced by the British Library is the sheer volume of data they are trying to preserve. As more content is created digitally, the library must find ways to store and preserve this information for future generations.</p>

<h2 id="national-digital-archive-of-datasets-ndad">National Digital Archive of Datasets (NDAD)</h2>

One incident, in particular, still brings a smile to my face when I think about the time a funny mistake caused our Postgres database server to come crashing down, leaving us in fits of laughter and a temporary state of panic.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/typo.jpg" alt="Man with broken PostgreSQL server" class="img-responsive" itemprop="image" /></p>

<p>It was a regular Monday morning at the office, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. I was sipping my coffee, going through my emails, and preparing for the day ahead. Little did I know that an innocent task was about to turn into a memorable adventure.</p>

<p>One of our developers, let’s call him Dave, came rushing into my office with a look of utter disbelief on his face. His eyes were wide, and he was frantically waving his arms, clearly in a state of distress. Naturally, I put aside my coffee and asked Dave what was wrong.</p>

<p>“Something’s gone terribly wrong with the database server,” he exclaimed, his voice a mixture of panic and amusement. “I was just making a small change, and suddenly everything stopped working!”</p>

<p>Curiosity piqued, I followed Dave to the server room where our beloved Postgres database server resided. The atmosphere was tense as we joined the rest of the team, who were huddled around the server, staring at the screen with a mixture of confusion and amusement.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath and asked Dave to walk me through the steps he had taken leading up to the crash. He sheepishly explained that he was working on a new feature that required him to add a new table to the database. It seemed like a routine task until he revealed the pivotal moment of the story.</p>

<p>“I was typing the SQL statement to create the new table,” Dave began, a slight grin forming on his face. “But you won’t believe what happened. I accidentally hit the ‘Enter’ key too soon!”</p>

<p>The room erupted in laughter, and I couldn’t help but join in. A single mistimed keystroke had caused all this chaos. With our laughter echoing in the server room, I asked Dave to show me the statement he had entered. As he pulled up the command history, the culprit was revealed:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">employees</span> <span class="k">DROP</span> <span class="k">COLUMN</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I burst into laughter again, unable to contain myself. The irony of the situation was too much to handle. Instead of creating a new table, Dave had inadvertently issued a command to drop the “name” column from the existing “employees” table. It was a classic case of a harmless typo leading to unintended consequences.</p>

<p>After our collective laughter died down, we had to face the reality of the situation. The database server was indeed down, and we needed to find a way to recover from Dave’s funny mistake. Taking a deep breath, I reassured the team that we would get through this and began formulating a plan to fix the issue.</p>

<p>We decided to restore the database from a recent backup, ensuring that we didn’t lose any critical data. However, this meant that we would also lose some of the changes made since the last backup. Thankfully, the backup was relatively recent, so the impact on our work was minimal.</p>

<p>As we patiently waited for the database to be restored, we reflected on the incident. The laughter and camaraderie in the server room helped ease the tension, reminding us that mistakes happen, even in the most unexpected and amusing ways. It served as a valuable lesson to double-check our commands, no matter how routine the task may seem.</p>

<p>Once the database was restored, we diligently re-applied the changes that had been lost. This time, we made sure to triple-check our statements and take extra precautions. The incident served as a humorous reminder to be more mindful of our keystrokes and to embrace the unexpected with a smile.</p>

<p>In the end, our Postgres database server was back up and running smoothly, and we were able to continue with our work. The incident became a legendary tale within our team, a story we would recount during team gatherings and social events, bringing laughter to everyone who heard it.</p>

<p>Years later, whenever someone new joined our team, they would inevitably hear the story of Dave’s fateful mistyped command. It became a rite of passage, a reminder that no matter how serious our work may be, it’s essential to find joy in the lighter moments and to be ready to face the unexpected with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p>And so, the tale of the mistyped SQL command that brought our Postgres database server crashing down lives on, forever etched in the annals of our team’s history. It serves as a reminder to approach our work with a sense of humor and to embrace the unexpected moments that add a little spice to our journey as database administrators.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Martin</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A funny firsthand account of how a simple mistake caused our database server to come crashing down]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How accessing databases has evolved through the years</title><link href="https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/16/how-accessing-databases-has-evolved-through-the-years.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How accessing databases has evolved through the years" /><published>2023-02-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-18T21:59:42+02:00</updated><id>https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/16/how-accessing-databases-has-evolved-through-the-years</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/16/how-accessing-databases-has-evolved-through-the-years.html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past two decades, the evolution of frameworks for accessing databases from various programming languages has greatly transformed the way developers interact with and migrate database schemas. These frameworks have not only simplified the process of <a href="/2023/02/07/choosing-the-right-database-schema-migration-tool.html">schema migrations</a> but also provided numerous other benefits that enhance development efficiency and productivity. In this article, we will explore the evolution of five popular frameworks—Hibernate, Entity Framework, Django ORM, Ruby on Rails’ ActiveRecord, and Sequelize—and examine how they make database schema migrations easier while offering additional advantages.</p>

<h2 id="hibernate">Hibernate</h2>

<p>Hibernate, a Java-based ORM framework, has played a pivotal role in simplifying database schema migrations. By leveraging Hibernate’s migration capabilities, developers can define entity classes that represent database tables and their relationships using annotations or XML configurations. When it’s time to migrate the database schema, Hibernate automatically generates and executes the necessary SQL statements to synchronize the schema with the defined entity classes. This eliminates the need for developers to write intricate SQL scripts for each schema change, resulting in a streamlined migration process.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hibernate offers features such as caching, lazy loading, and query optimization. These features enhance application performance by reducing unnecessary database interactions and optimizing query execution, leading to faster and more efficient data access.</p>

<h2 id="entity-framework">Entity Framework</h2>

<p>Entity Framework, a popular ORM framework for .NET, provides a Code First approach that simplifies database schema migrations. Developers can define their entity classes using attributes or fluent API configurations. Entity Framework then automatically generates migration scripts based on the changes made to the entity classes and applies them to the database.</p>

<p>The framework’s migration system keeps track of applied migrations, allowing developers to migrate the database schema to a specific version or roll back changes when necessary. This versioning and rollback capability provides greater control and flexibility during the migration process. Additionally, Entity Framework offers features like automatic SQL generation, data validation, and concurrency control, further enhancing the overall development experience.</p>

<h2 id="django-orm">Django ORM</h2>

<p>Django ORM, a Python-based framework, offers robust support for database schema migrations. Developers can define their schema changes in migration files using Django’s built-in migration system. The migration system generates and executes SQL statements to modify the database schema accordingly.</p>

<p>Django’s migration system also supports database schema versioning, allowing developers to migrate the database to a specific version or revert changes. This version control integration ensures that database schema changes are properly managed and trackable alongside the application’s codebase. Additionally, Django ORM provides features like automatic SQL generation, database schema introspection, and support for multiple database backends, making it a versatile and powerful tool for data access and migration.</p>

<h2 id="ruby-on-rails-activerecord">Ruby on Rails’ ActiveRecord</h2>

<p>Ruby on Rails, a web development framework, offers the ActiveRecord library for database access and migrations. ActiveRecord provides automatic migration support, enabling developers to define schema changes in migration files using Ruby’s DSL.</p>

<p>Rails’ migration system keeps track of applied migrations, allowing developers to easily migrate the database schema to a specific version or roll back changes. The migration system also abstracts away the underlying SQL statements, allowing developers to focus on the logical structure of the schema changes rather than the implementation details. Additionally, ActiveRecord integrates well with version control systems, enabling collaborative development and ensuring proper versioning of database schema changes.</p>

<h2 id="sequelize">Sequelize</h2>

<p>Sequelize is a powerful JavaScript ORM framework that supports multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It provides an intuitive API for defining models, relationships, and database migrations.</p>

<p>Sequelize simplifies database schema migrations through its migration feature. Developers can define schema changes in migration files using Sequelize’s DSL. The framework automatically generates the necessary SQL statements to modify the database schema and applies the migrations to the database.</p>

<p>Apart from migration support, Sequelize offers additional features like query building, database connection pooling, and transaction management. These features improve application performance and scalability, making Sequelize a popular choice for database access in Node.js applications.</p>

<p>As you can see, the evolution of frameworks for accessing databases from different programming languages over the last 20 years has revolutionized the way developers handle database schema migrations. Frameworks such as Hibernate, Entity Framework, Django ORM, Ruby on Rails’ ActiveRecord, and Sequelize have simplified the migration process, abstracting away the complexities of SQL scripting and providing higher-level abstractions for schema changes. These frameworks offer benefits like standardized access, version control integration, automated SQL generation, and additional features that enhance development efficiency and application performance. By leveraging these frameworks, developers can focus more on the logic of their applications and spend less time dealing with low-level database interactions, ultimately accelerating the development process and fostering robust and scalable applications.</p>]]></content><author><name>Paul Martin</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The evolution of frameworks for accessing databases from different programming languages over the past two decades.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Choosing the Right Database Schema Migration Tool</title><link href="https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/07/choosing-the-right-database-schema-migration-tool.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Choosing the Right Database Schema Migration Tool" /><published>2023-02-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-18T22:10:23+02:00</updated><id>https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/07/choosing-the-right-database-schema-migration-tool</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://diymambo1.github.io/2023/02/07/choosing-the-right-database-schema-migration-tool.html"><![CDATA[<p>As a developer who has worked with multiple database schema migration tools, I can wholeheartedly agree with Declan Clark’s article on the “<a href="https://www.declanclark.uk/database-schema-migration-tools-choice-dilemma.php">database schema migration tools choice</a>”. With so many options available, it can be challenging to decide which tool to use for your specific project needs.</p>

<p>Clark highlights several key factors to consider when selecting a database schema migration tool, such as ease of use, version control, automation, and support for various databases. These factors are indeed essential and can greatly impact the success of a project.</p>

<p>In my experience, one tool that stands out for its ease of use and automation capabilities is Flyway. Flyway is an open-source database migration tool that supports several databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. With Flyway, developers can easily manage and migrate database schema changes using SQL scripts or Java-based migrations.</p>

<p>To illustrate the use of Flyway in practice, let’s consider an example. Suppose we have a PostgreSQL database with a “customers” table that contains information about customers, such as their name, email, and phone number. We want to add a new column to the table called “address”, which will store the customer’s address information. Using Flyway, we can create a new migration file called “V1__add_address_column.sql” with the following SQL code:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">customers</span> <span class="k">ADD</span> <span class="k">COLUMN</span> <span class="n">address</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we have created the migration file, we can run it using Flyway’s command-line interface or integrate it into our application’s build process. Flyway will automatically track which migrations have been applied and which still need to be executed, making it easy to manage and migrate database schema changes over time.</p>

<p>Another tool that Clark mentions is Liquibase, which offers similar migration capabilities as Flyway but with additional features such as rollback support and database refactoring. Liquibase also supports a wide range of databases, including SQL Server, DB2, and Sybase. While Liquibase can be more complex to set up and use than Flyway, it offers more advanced features for larger and more complex projects.</p>

<p>To illustrate Liquibase’s capabilities, let’s consider an example where we want to refactor the “customers” table in our PostgreSQL database to split the “name” column into separate “first_name” and “last_name” columns. We can create a new Liquibase migration file called “V1__refactor_customer_table.xml” with the following code:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;changeSet</span> <span class="na">author=</span><span class="s">"me"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"refactor_customer_table"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;renameColumn</span> <span class="na">oldColumnName=</span><span class="s">"name"</span> <span class="na">newColumnName=</span><span class="s">"first_name"</span> <span class="na">tableName=</span><span class="s">"customers"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;addColumn</span> <span class="na">tableName=</span><span class="s">"customers"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;column</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"last_name"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"VARCHAR(255)"</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/addColumn&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/changeSet&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we have created the migration file, we can run it using Liquibase’s command-line interface or integrate it into our application’s build process. Liquibase will automatically track and manage the schema changes, including rollbacks if necessary.</p>

PostgreSQL, a leading open-source relational database, offers a range of techniques to enhance performance. One often underestimated factor is the proper arrangement of fields within database tables. The organization of fields can have a significant impact on query execution time, storage efficiency, and overall database performance. This article delves into the importance of properly arranging fields in PostgreSQL tables, explores the underlying principles, and provides practical examples and SQL code snippets to demonstrate the tangible benefits of this optimization technique.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-significance-of-field-arrangement">Understanding the Significance of Field Arrangement</h2>

<p>When designing database tables, it is crucial to recognize how the arrangement of fields can influence performance. The physical order of fields on disk directly impacts data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. By strategically organizing fields, developers can optimize database operations and enhance overall efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="storage-alignment-and-disk-access">Storage Alignment and Disk Access</h3>

<p>Proper field arrangement ensures efficient storage alignment, minimizing disk access time. When related fields are stored together, the database can read them in a single disk I/O operation, resulting in faster query execution. Conversely, random scattering of fields across a table may necessitate multiple disk I/O operations, significantly impacting performance.</p>

<h3 id="data-types-and-disk-compression">Data Types and Disk Compression</h3>

<p>The arrangement of fields also affects disk compression techniques. Grouping similar data types together enables better compression ratios, reducing the storage footprint and enhancing disk I/O efficiency. Separating numeric or boolean fields from text or binary data can yield improved compression results.</p>

<h2 id="practical-examples-of-field-arrangement">Practical Examples of Field Arrangement</h2>

<p>Let’s dive into practical examples that illustrate how field arrangement influences PostgreSQL performance.</p>

<h3 id="indexing-and-selectivity">Indexing and Selectivity</h3>

<p>Proper field arrangement can enhance index utilization and improve query performance. When frequently queried fields are placed before less frequently queried ones, indexes can be utilized more effectively. For instance, consider a user table with columns like “user_id,” “first_name,” “last_name,” and “email.” If queries primarily filter by “user_id” and “email,” placing these fields at the beginning of the table enhances index selectivity, accelerating search operations.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">user_id</span> <span class="nb">SERIAL</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">email</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">last_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>

<h3 id="hot-and-cold-fields">Hot and Cold Fields</h3>

<p>Arranging frequently accessed or modified fields (referred to as “hot” fields) separately from rarely accessed or modified fields (known as “cold” fields) can optimize performance. By separating hot fields from cold fields, contention for disk I/O is reduced, leading to faster data retrieval and update operations.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">user_profile</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">user_id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">hot_field1</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">hot_field2</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">cold_field1</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">cold_field2</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="wide-tables-and-vertical-decomposition">Wide Tables and Vertical Decomposition</h3>

<p>For wide tables with numerous columns, vertical decomposition can improve performance. Breaking the table into narrower tables with related fields grouped together reduces the amount of data read from disk, thus improving query execution time.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">user_profile</span> <span class="p">(</span> 
    <span class="n">user_id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">personal_info</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">personal_info_id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
        <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span> 
        <span class="n">last_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>
    <span class="p">),</span> 
    <span class="n">contact_info</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="n">contact_info_id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
        <span class="n">email</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span> 
        <span class="n">phone_number</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>
    <span class="p">)</span>

<h2 id="implementing-field-arrangement-in-postgresql">Implementing Field Arrangement in PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>Now, let’s explore the implementation details and learn how to arrange fields in PostgreSQL tables to maximize performance.</p>

<h3 id="alter-table-changing-field-order">ALTER TABLE: Changing Field Order</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL provides the ALTER TABLE statement to modify table structures and change the order of fields. The ALTER TABLE command, combined with the SET ATTRIBUTE option, allows you to rearrange the physical order of fields in a table, thereby optimizing disk access.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">my_table</span>
<span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">COLUMN</span> <span class="n">column_name1</span> <span class="k">SET</span> <span class="k">POSITION</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">COLUMN</span> <span class="n">column_name2</span> <span class="k">SET</span> <span class="k">POSITION</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">COLUMN</span> <span class="n">column_name3</span> <span class="k">SET</span> <span class="k">POSITION</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="column-order-in-create-table">Column Order in CREATE TABLE</h3>

<p>When creating new tables, consider the order of columns in the CREATE TABLE statement. By following the principles discussed earlier, you can define the desired order of columns from the outset, ensuring optimal performance.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">user_id</span> <span class="nb">SERIAL</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">email</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">first_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">last_name</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="vertical-decomposition-with-foreign-keys">Vertical Decomposition with Foreign Keys</h3>

<p>In addition to arranging fields within a table, PostgreSQL allows you to leverage foreign keys to achieve vertical decomposition across related tables. By separating frequently accessed or modified fields into separate tables and establishing proper relationships using foreign keys, you can further enhance performance.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">users</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">user_id</span> <span class="nb">SERIAL</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">profile_id</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="k">FOREIGN</span> <span class="k">KEY</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">profile_id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">REFERENCES</span> <span class="n">user_profile</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">profile_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">user_profile</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">profile_id</span> <span class="nb">SERIAL</span> <span class="k">PRIMARY</span> <span class="k">KEY</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">hot_field1</span> <span class="nb">INT</span><span class="p">,</span> 
    <span class="n">hot_field2</span> <span class="nb">VARCHAR</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
